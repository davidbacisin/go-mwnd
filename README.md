Moving window order statistics for Go. Computes mean, minimum, maximum, and population 
variance over a sliding window, supporting both fixed-size and 
exponentially-weighted windows. The fixed-size window also supports computing any quantile.

## Usage ðŸš€
```go
// Define a fixed moving window that holds up to 5 values
w := mwnd.Fixed[int](5)

// Note that len(values) > w.Size(), so when the last value (10) is Put,
// then the first value (1) will be evicted.
values := []int{1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 10}
for _, v := range values {
    w.Put(v)
}

fmt.Printf("Size: %d\n", w.Size())
fmt.Printf("Min: %d\n", w.Min())
fmt.Printf("Max: %d\n", w.Max())
fmt.Printf("Mean: %.2f\n", w.Mean())
fmt.Printf("Variance: %.2f\n", w.Variance())
fmt.Printf("Median: %d\n", w.Quantile(0.5))
```

## Example visualizations ðŸ“Š
The following plot shows generated data (solid purple line) and the moving min, max, mean, and variance 
for a fixed window of 500 values:

Plotted below are the first and ninth deciles, all quartiles, and 99th percentile of the same data set and fixed window parameters:

The following plot shows the same data with statistics from an exponentially-weighted moving window 
with alpha = 0.004:

Note especially the differences in min, max, and variance between these two implementations: as a result,
they are not interchangeable and instead can only approximate each other.

## Limitations and Future Work ðŸ§ª
- The moving window implementations are not safe for concurrent reads or writes. Consider using 
[`sync.Mutex`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Mutex) or [`sync.RWMutex`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#RWMutex) 
to synchronize access under a concurrent workload.
- **Random sampling**: In some cases, it may be impractical to include every value 
in the window. Instead, a random subset could be probabilistically sampled. The variance 
calculation would need to be corrected for bias.
